# Counter Application in Flutter
## Stateless Widgets: 
They don’t allow you to rebuild your widget again. Just like in counter application, it doesn’t refresh the display with the updated value, even if it is incremented and shown in debugPrint() during production.

## Stateful Widgets:
These allow you to rebuild your widget and refresh your screen while updating the value of ‘x’ with the incremented value. <br>

**Although both the Stateless and Stateful widgets are same in terms of designing the UI of the application, but Stateless widgets doesn’t allow rebuilding of the widgets.**
